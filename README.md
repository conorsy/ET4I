Evapotranspiration for Ireland (ET4I): Supporting agricultural decisions by producing daily gridded ET and ET0 maps at 1 km resolution for Ireland

This research project aims to produce gridded Actual Evapotranspiration (ET) and Potential Evapotranspiration (ET0) gridded datasets for Ireland.

Met Éireann currently produces 1 km gridded products of rainfall and temperature based on climatological observations. These would be greatly complemented if the potential (ET0) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) could be estimated on this grid to provide the input into hydrological models as well as agricultural decision support systems on a daily time scale.

This project will use state-of-the-art methods and data, including satellite data, data from the Irish Soil Moisture Observation Network (ISMON, 2022), and the National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory (NASCO, 2020) flux tower data, coupled with forecasts from high resolution numerical weather prediction (HARMONIE’s surface model SURFEX) and Machine Learning techniques.
